**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report

---

### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.
I have also create a set of images that display step by step how pipeline works.
My pipeline consisted out of 7 steps:
#### 1. Convert image to grey from BGR
   By using provided `def grayscale` function, inside I switched to use `cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY` because I am using `cv2.imread()`
#### 2. Remove noise by applying Gaussian Blur with kernel size `5`
   I used kernel size `5` from the experiance in lecture where we learned how to use Gaussian Blur, it worked fine on this project
#### 3. Apply Canny Edges aplgorythm
![Canny](/test_images_final/whiteCarLaneSwitch_canny.jpg)
   I defined parameters for Canny edges and applied it to the blured grey picture of the image, I picked `low_threshold = 50` and `high_threshold = 150` because we used it during lecture and quiz and it worked on the current project
#### 4. Define a four sides of polygon to mask noise
![Region of interest](/test_images_final/whiteCarLaneSwitch_region_of_interest.jpg)
   I needed to create a polygon that would cover the area of lane lines and remove the noise of other objects of similar color for video 1 and 2 I went with `[(20,imshape[0]),(450,325), (510, 325), (imshape[1]-20,imshape[0])]` where apex defined by two coordinates of `(450,325), (510, 325)`.
   It does not work for the challenge video, I had to change it to `[(20,imshape[0]),(610,430), (700, 430), (imshape[1],imshape[0])]` where the apex moved to `(610,430), (700, 430)`, this helped a little to maintain lines mapping lanes, because this video has shadows and road curves under different angel than in other two videos, my algorythm performed not as well as on other two vides, I have to continue working on it.
#### 5. Use Hough algorythm to show lines
![Hough Lines](/test_images_final/whiteCarLaneSwitch_hough_lines.jpg)
    On this spet I had to provide input params to Hough algorythm. I descided to use 
    ```
    rho = 2                        # distance resolution in pixels of the Hough grid
    theta = np.pi/180              # angular resolution in radians of the Hough grid
    threshold = 15                 # minimum number of votes (intersections in Hough grid cell)
    min_line_len = 40              # minimum number of pixels making up a line
    max_line_gap = 20              # maximum gap in pixels between connectable line segments
    ```
    I went with `rho = 2` because it worked and we picked it during lectures and quiz. Same with `theta`. As for `threshold = 15`, `min_line_len = 40` and `max_line_gap = 20` I had to experiment and ended up testing best combination of values above.
#### 6. Determine positive and negative slopes for right and left lanes and eliminate empty lines
 Â  This part was quite chellenging, I had to come up with a solution to loop through lines calculated by Hough algorythm, identify empty lines. 
   In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function.
   I used slope equation (y2-y1)/(x2-x1). 
   If line had a positive slope I added it to right set of `left_slopes` and `left_line_pts`, if it was negative I appended it to right selt of `right_slopes` and `right_line_pts`. Then I used `max` function to look for most frequent slope. 
   When I have identified left and right most frequent slope I used it to create clean version of left and right lines and points. 
   At the end I used `cv2.fitLine` openCV function to draw lines.
#### 7. use weighted image provided function to overlay hough lanes and original image. I didn't change input params, after some experimenting, I descided to leave them as is.

It helped a lot to have a set of test images to test my code before running it on the video, it was faster and more efficient.

### 2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline

I have recorded two additional videos. One on the highway in the far left lane and one in the middle lanes on town road.

##### Challenge Yellow Left
In order to recognize lanes on this video I had to adjust vertices. The best value I tested is
```
vertices = np.array([[(0,imshape[0]),(450,435), (510, 435), (imshape[1]-150,imshape[0])]], dtype=np.int32)
```
My algorythm is working okay on this video. There are a few lines on the video where they not suppose to be. I think I have to improve my algothm of drawing lanes to do a better job with rejecting outliers.

##### Challenge White Middle
In order to recognize lanes on this video I had to adjust vertices. The best value I tested is
```
vertices = np.array([[(20,imshape[0]),(410,435), (510, 435), (imshape[1]-150,imshape[0])]], dtype=np.int32)
```
My algorythm is working okay on this video. There are a few lines on the video where they not suppose to be. I think I have to improve my algothm of drawing lanes to do a better job with rejecting outliers.

### 3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline

Possible improvements to my pipeline could be:
    - better identifying and rejecting outliers while drawing lines
    - making sure that left and right lines alway extend from the bottmo of the image to the horizon
    - may be use an algorythm like neural network to better see shadows and learn from other images to identify lanes without hardcoding a rectangular to mask lanes
